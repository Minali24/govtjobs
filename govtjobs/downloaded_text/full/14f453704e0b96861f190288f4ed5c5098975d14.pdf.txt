Representations on Provisional Shortlist and Exam Dates for 2nd Stage CBT  

 

 
The results of First Stage Computer Based Test (CBT) with the lists of provisionally shortlisted 
candidates for appearing in 2nd Stage CBT have been published on the official websites of all RRBs on 
02-11-2018. In order to maintain transparency, RRBs have also provided facility to candidates for 
viewing of the question paper along with the answer keys. 
 
RRBs have received certain representations from the candidates raising issues on answer keys and 
translation in few of the questions. In response, RRBs have decided to examine all such issues afresh. 
 
 After this review, final keys along with the revised scores will be published again. The revised list of 
shortlisted candidates will also be published on the websites of RRBs for the information of all the 
candidates. 
 
RRBs have also received representations requesting postponement of 2nd Stage CBT on account of 
clashing of dates with the CBT for CEN 02/2018 and/or academic examinations. In view of the above, 
the 2nd stage CBT scheduled earlier from 12th December is postponed and shall now start from 24th 
December 2018. 
 
RRBs reiterate that they value the inputs/feedback from their candidates and respond dynamically 
to all such inputs.  
 
RRBs request all candidates to follow only the information/updates provided on official websites of 
RRBs and do not fall prey to any false/unauthentic information.
