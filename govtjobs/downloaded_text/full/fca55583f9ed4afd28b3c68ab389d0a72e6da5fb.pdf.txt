Further, attention is also drawn to the Notice dated 01.08.2018 published on

(Cat No), Qualification, Suitability of the post for various disabilities and Medical 

standards is given in Annexure-A. The details of RRB wise and Railway/Unit 

wise vacancies for the posts is given in Annexure- B 

 



 

2.0 Selection of RRB and filling up the priority of Options for the 

Railway/Unit and posts notified against the RRB 

Candidates have applied for the posts of ALP & Technicians against CEN 

01/2018 in general and not to any specific RRB. The 1st stage CBT was 

conducted between 09-08-2018 to 04-09-2018. Vide para 7.0 under the 

heading “Important Instructions of the CEN, it was indicated that the option for 

RRB, Railway and Posts shall be taken from among the candidates securing 

community wise minimum qualifying marks in 1st stage CBT.  

Considering that Objection Tracker and finalization of keys based on inputs 

received are in progress, in order to save time, it has now been decided by 

RRBs that all the candidates who appeared in 1st stage CBT will be permitted 

to select the RRB and fill the option for the Railway/Unit and posts notified 

against the RRB as per Annexure B.  

Accordingly all the candidates who have appeared in 1st stage CBT may login 

through the link provided on the websites of RRBs and complete the RRB 

selection and option of the Railway/Unit and posts. 

The selection of RRBs and priority of options for the posts and Railway/Unit 

once finally submitted cannot be modified. Hence, candidates may decide 

firmly and correctly the RRB of their choice and then only proceed to fill the 

priority for the Railway/Unit and posts. 

It is advisable that the candidates indicate their priority of options for as many 

posts as they are eligible for. In case, any candidate opts for only few posts, 

he/she will be considered only for those opted posts and not for other posts.  

All the candidates who have appeared in the 1st stage CBT have to select 

the RRB and priority of options for Railway/Production unit & posts failing 

which their candidature will not be considered for shortlisting for 2nd stage 

CBT. 

3.0 Selection of Exam Trade 

At the time of application, candidates having more than one eligible 

qualification viz ITI/NAC, HSC and Diploma/Degree have selected more than 

one exam trade as per their qualifications. RRBs have also received 

representations from candidates for change of exam trade chosen at the time 

of application. 

To facilitate candidates to appear in only one exam trade in Part ‘B’ of 2nd stage 

CBT, RRBs have now decided that those candidates who have opted for more 

than one exam trade in view of their multiple qualification will be given an 

opportunity to select only one exam trade of their choice. Candidates qualifying 

in Part ‘B’ of 2nd stage CBT in the chosen trade shall be considered eligible for 

all the posts for which they possess prescribed minimum educational 

qualification based on their merit in Part ‘A’ of  2nd stage CBT. Further, 



  

 

considering that for certain posts the prescribed minimum educational 

qualification is HSC in Maths and Physics, RRBs have also decided to make 

available Maths & Physics as an Exam Trade with the syllabus of CBSE for 

HSC over and above the relevant trades mentioned in the notification for such 

candidates.  

Further, RRBs have decided to give a one time opportunity to candidates who 

have chosen single exam trade in their application to change their exam trade 

from among the relevant trades of their qualification in case they wish to 

change the exam trade. For candidates with only ITI/NAC qualification the 

exam trade shall be their ITI/NAC trade given in the application and cannot be 

changed. 

4.0 Confirmation/Modification of Bank Account Details for Application Fee  

Refund 

To facilitate refund of application fee to the candidates correctly, all the 

candidates are required to confirm Bank Account Details viz Beneficiary Name, 

Bank IFSC Code and the Account Number to which the refund is to be credited. 

If the candidates wish to modify the account details furnished earlier, they can 

select Modify Account option and enter the OTP sent to their Registered 

Mobile Number. The account details once confirmed/modified cannot be 

modified again. 

Candidates should complete all the above activities well before the closing 

time of 23.59 Hrs on 01-10-2018 to avoid last minute rush and internet 

related issues. Candidates should note that the details once confirmed 

and submitted cannot be modified and hence they are advised to select 

RRB, Railway/Unit, options for Posts, Exam Trade and Account Details 

carefully and correctly.
