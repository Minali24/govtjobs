Refund of Examination Fee 
 
Railway Recruitment Boards have initiated Refund of Examination Fee to the candidates 
who had attended the First Stage Computer Based Test (CBT) for ALP/Technicians against 
CEN 01/2018.  
 
During the refund process, it is noticed that for some of the candidates the refund has failed 
due to incorrect Bank details furnished by them such as wrong account number, wrong IFSC 
Code of the Bank Branch, filling up customer ID in place of account number etc.  
 
Candidates whose refund transaction has failed due to incorrect bank account details will be 
intimated regarding the failure of refund through SMS on 17-12-2018. To facilitate these 
candidates to correct their Bank Account details, a Bank Account Rectification Link will be 
provided on the official websites of RRBs which will be live from 18/12/2018 to 25/12/2018.  
 
Candidates are advised to make use of this final opportunity to correct the Bank details to 

enable refund.  While filling the Bank Account information, please ensure that the Bank 

Account Number and IFSC Code entered are correct.  

Please note that this is the last opportunity and therefore you are advised to furnish correct 
details of Bank Account Number and IFSC code. Once you submit the bank details, further 
editing of bank details is NOT permissible and RRB shall not be responsible for further failure 
of refund, if any, and no correspondence will be entertained in this regard.
